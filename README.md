# Printera Server

Printera Server is an open-source backend infrastructure designed for the Printera ecosystem. It handles essential data relations and provides a robust API to interact with, mutate, and query the data. Through its interactions with AWS services, Printera Server ensures efficient resource management and provisioning.

## Overview

- **Interactions with AWS**: Printera Server leverages the AWS SDK to create and manage various AWS resources, such as IAM roles & policies and identity roles & policies. This capability ensures that the server can effectively organize permissions and other critical AWS entities.
- **IoT Management**: While Printera Server sets the stage for AWS IoT resources, including creating IoT "things", generating certificates, and organizing roles and policy permissions, the real-time interaction between 3D printers and frontend clients is facilitated by the frontend directly connecting to AWS IoT MQTT topics.

## Tech Stack

- **Nest.js**: A progressive Node.js framework for scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
- **Typescript**: Offers static typing for a robust and error-free codebase.
- **Drizzle ORM (with MySQL2 Driver)**: Defines and manages data relations in a type-safe manner with MySQL.
- **AWS SDK**: The backbone for programmatic interactions with AWS services.
